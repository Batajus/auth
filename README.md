# Auth

This project contains a client and server application for a default user authentication and registration, whereby the authorization is realised with JSON Web Tokens. 

The idea of the project is to provide a basic user authentication for a defined number of features/projects, which an admin user can add. So it shouldn't be required anymore to implement a user authentication for each project.

## Client and Server
The client consists of Angular in the currently latest version and the backend uses Express
